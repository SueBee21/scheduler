## Project Development: 
* On opening the page, the current day is displayed in the header, using JQuery selector to display the currentDay.
* Bootstrap was usend to create a calender within HTML table tags. The calender represents normal business hours 9am - 5pm, with time, text area for entering user events, and a save button.  

* Link to Moment JS library to access current time.  
* Timeblocks are colorcoded to indicate past, current, and furture hours.  This was accomplished with Javascript loop and JQuery selector to target current hour and associated CSS class.
